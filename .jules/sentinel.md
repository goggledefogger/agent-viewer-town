## 2026-02-14 - Trusting Hook Inputs for Shell Execution
**Vulnerability:** Potential for arbitrary command execution context if hook inputs are compromised.
**Learning:** The server uses `cwd` provided in hook payloads to execute `git` commands via `execFile`. While `execFile` avoids shell injection, the `cwd` option controls the working directory, which could be abused if the input source wasn't trusted (Claude Code).
**Prevention:** Always validate `cwd` against an allowlist or ensure it resides within expected project paths, even for trusted internal tools.

## 2026-02-14 - Child Process Command Injection Risk
**Vulnerability:** Use of `child_process.exec` allowing for potential shell command injection if arguments become dynamic, and vulnerability to executable hijacking via the current directory on Windows systems.
**Learning:** `packages/server/src/touchbar.ts` used `exec` for external commands like `pgrep` and `open`.
**Prevention:** Replace `child_process.exec` with `child_process.execFile` utilizing an array of arguments, and include `{ env: { ...process.env, NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath: '1' } }` in the options to mitigate current-directory executable hijacking.
